## Problem Statement

Inefficient energy use is a growing concern in residential, commercial, and industrial environments due to increasing energy costs and environmental impacts. Many users lack real-time information about their energy consumption, resulting in waste, higher expenses, and missed opportunities to adopt more sustainable habits. There is a need for a reliable, affordable, and user-friendly solution that enables users to monitor and analyze energy usage in real time to optimize consumption and reduce costs.[5][4]

## Scope of the Project

The Energy Tracker project focuses on developing an IoT-based system that continuously monitors energy consumption from different sources in a given environment. The scope includes real-time data collection, analysis, pattern identification, and user-friendly visualization through a dashboard. The project does not cover physical installation of sensors, but it assumes integration with existing metering hardware where available.[4][5]

## Target Users

- Homeowners seeking to lower their electricity bills and carbon footprint
- Businesses and facility managers aiming to optimize operations and reduce energy costs
- Educational institutions eager to promote energy awareness
- Researchers and energy consultants who require detailed consumption analytics[5]

## High-Level Features

- Real-time energy monitoring and data visualization
- Customizable alerts for abnormal or excessive consumption
- Historical data analysis and reporting[4]
- User-friendly dashboard with usage trends and breakdowns
- Exportable usage reports for audits and compliance
- Compatibility with smart meters and IoT devices[5]
