Project Title
Energy Tracker

Overview of the Project
Energy Tracker is a digital solution designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize real-time energy consumption from multiple sources. The tool helps users track electricity, manage carbon footprints, and optimize energy usage for cost savings and environmental impact.​

Features
Real-time tracking of energy consumption data
Automated data collection and processing​
Customizable dashboards to visualize energy trends
Reports on usage patterns, cost, and environmental impact
Alerts for inefficiencies or unusual consumption
Export or share reports for compliance and audits

Technologies/Tools Used
IoT sensors for data acquisition​
Cloud computing platforms for storage and analytics
Web dashboard built using modern frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)
Backend: Node.js or Python
Database: MongoDB, Firebase, or SQL
API integration with smart meters or public grid data
Optional: Machine Learning for trend identification​

Steps to Install & Run the Project
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install dependencies using npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt (as per tech stack).
Configure environment variables (database keys, API endpoints, etc.).
Start the backend server: npm run server or python app.py.
Launch the frontend app: npm start or open the HTML file.
Access the dashboard via the provided local or cloud URL.

Instructions for Testing
Unit and integration tests can be run with commands such as npm test or pytest.
